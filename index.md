## A Journey to the Center of SwiftUI with Firebase
#### June 25th 2020

### For this entry we'll be using:
- Xcode Version 12.0 beta (12A6159)
- iOS 14.0
- Firebase

### Here's the plan
Today we're going to take a look at writing a simple Todo app using Swift UI that's been updated for Xcode 12 beta and iOS 14. 
- First we'll discuss the removal of AppDelegate/SceneDelegate
- Then we'll jump into structuring our code using views, viewmodels, repositories, models, and services
- Next I'll show you how to construct the main list view
- After that we'll connect our view to Firebase
- Finally we'll wrap it up with Apple authentication
